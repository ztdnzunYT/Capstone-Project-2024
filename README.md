             Description: Still like the feel of old school games? Well you have come to the right game! Pixel Baseball is a               
             simple pitch and hit game. Get your time down just right for a powerful hit!

             Objective: Easy, hit as many homeruns as you can! There is no score keeping!

             Small bug: If you hit the ball to center field, expect a delay before throwing the next pitch. To know the pitcher is ready to pitch, the baseball will reappear on the pitcher's mound.
